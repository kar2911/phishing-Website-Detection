# 1. Trained models, scalers, and other serialized objects.
# These are artifacts generated by your code and can be large.
# This will ignore files like:
# - models/phish_detector_pipeline.joblib
# - notebooks/phishing_model.pkl
# - notebooks/scaler.pkl
# - notebooks/feature_columns.pkl
*.pkl
*.joblib
*.h5

# 2. Datasets. Large data files should not be committed to Git.
# This will ignore the entire 'data' directory including 'Phishing_URL.csv'.
# If your dataset is very small, you can remove the line below.
# For large datasets, it's better to provide a download link in your README.md.
